# A Shallow Introduction to Deep Learning

This repository contains the [slides](https://github.com/airalcorn2/shallow-deep-learning/blob/master/shallow_deep_learning.pdf) and accompanying [code](https://github.com/airalcorn2/shallow-deep-learning/blob/master/shallow_deep_learning.py) for the "A Shallow Introduction to Deep Learning" workshop I gave to the Research & Development team while I was a deep learning fellow with the Cleveland Indians.
